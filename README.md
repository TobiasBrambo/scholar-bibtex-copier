# Scholar BibTeX Copier

Automatically copy BibTeX citation, instead of having to open new page, manually copy, and then go back to google scholar.

When clicking the BibTeX button the following happens:
- A new tab opens, with the citation content
- The contents are copied to clipboard
- The tab closes

A slight delay exists here to ensure the contents are properly copied, this delay can be tweaked. This works for all the different ways you can open a BibTeX citation in Google Scholar, and in the Google Scholar PDF Reader (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-scholar-pdf-reader/dahenjhkoodjbpjheillcadbppiidmhp).

The extension is available in the Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scholar-bibtex-copier/ihccfpbmoeeiibppdgcjjcoahggpfohl


### Custom changes

If you wish to make custom changes to the plugin (or just not use the chrome store), the plugin must be installed manually using the following steps:
- Clone this repo
- Go to: `chrome://extensions`
- Enable developer mode in the top right corner
- Click "Load unpacked" in the top left
- Select the directory for this repo

The plugin should then work, if you do any custom changes to the plugin you then need to refresh the plugin in the extensions page.
